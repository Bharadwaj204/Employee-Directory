const mockEmployees = [
    { id: 1, firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', email: 'john.doe@company.com', department: 'IT', role: 'Developer' },
    // ... more employees
];

// Simulate Freemarker assignment
// <#assign employees = mockEmployeeList>
let employees = [...mockEmployees];
```

### Employee Data Structure
